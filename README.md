TOP Flex Page Project wherein Churro's business get's the bump.

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage from scratch based off of an image of a final product template for a business webpage.

To customize it, I'll be creating a business page for Churro, my fiances long haired chihuahua.

The business will include private security, emotional support, babysitting, and apple management.
